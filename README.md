this brings me stress

please help me with this

no one wants to help me

maybe i should scrap it

maybe i should just give up my goals.

and live knowing i could've done something i wanted to do but i didn't

i have strong belief that nobody cares and nobody wants to help, rather they want me to go away

i don't know anymore

will someone help?

or will people just agree im stupid and annoying?

why

is there something wrong with me?

should i finish this?

why didn't they answer my question

i can't choose

help

help

hellp
